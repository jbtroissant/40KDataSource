You can then use those dice to activate up to two Blessings of Khorne from the Blessings of Khorne list (see below). Each Blessing of Khorne specifies the dice results it requires (where a number is specified, a double or triple of that value or higher is required). You can only activate each Blessing of Khorne once per battle round. Any unused dice from the Blessings of Khorne roll are then discarded.\n\nOnce activated, each Blessing of Khorne applies to all units from your army with this ability until the end of the battle round.",
